    <h1>URI Bug</h1>
    <p>
      This Netlify app has a catch-all rewrite:<br />
      /files/* /index.html 200
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is no force, so shadowing should still work. And it does work
      for our link with no encoded characters:
      <a href="/files/[myfile].html">/files/[myfile].html</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      But it does <bold>not</bold> work for our links with encoded square
      brackets, encoded space, or unencoded space:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="/files/%5Bmyfile%5D.html">/files/%5Bmyfile%5D.html</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/files/my%20file.html">/files/my%20file.html</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/files/my file.html">/files/my file.html</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The links all work when there is no redirect (as they should!). Here are
      these same three links, but this time pointing to the /other/ folder
      (where the redirect does not apply):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="/other/%5Bmyfile%5D.html">/other/%5Bmyfile%5D.html</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/other/my%20file.html">/other/my%20file.html</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/other/my file.html">/other/my file.html</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This error exists on both netlify.app as well as in netlify-cli. For
      netlify-cli, the fix is to wrap the reqUrl.pathname in the proxy.js file
      inside decodeURIComponent():
      <a
        href="https://github.com/netlify/cli/blob/c4ce6bba298ab3c7deb0d5b409e9c36ff21fd3da/src/utils/proxy.js#L149"
